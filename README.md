General Information for our Volunteers
ReDIpedia 

Servus! We welcome you to our ReDI Munich family of amazing volunteers. Let’s get to know ourselves better. At this point, we assume you have heard of us somewhere or have attended any of our info sessions so some of this information will be familiar to you, but we hope you find something useful in our ReDIpedia. 


General FAQ

What is ReDI School? 

ReDI School offers education to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow. We use technology to connect human potential with employment opportunities with dignity and humility. We value reliability, usefulness, care and playfulness.

Our educational goal is to provide students with useful knowledge that is appreciated by industry and academia to support their accelerated integration into the German labor market and into German society.

What is ReDI Munich? 

ReDI Munich is the second branch of ReDI School after the huge success of ReDI School in Berlin. Fun fact, the city of Munich actually wanted that ReDI School opened in Munich and they are our main sponsor for Munich!

How do I apply as a volunteer? 

Go to our homepage (www.redi-school.org) and select “Join as a volunteer” and then “Sign up as a volunteer” or click here.

I have signed up through the form but have not received any answer yet. What should I do?
The recruitment process will only start 2 months before the start of a semester. This means that you might not be contacted right away, but might have to wait some weeks/few months before we contact you for a meeting or info session. But don’t worry - you will in any case be invited to all of our social events.
What skills are you looking for?
Right now, we offer courses in web development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React), Java and Python programming, data science, and UI/UX. However, we are open to suggestions if you can bring the skills to offer a course.
Our Women Program however, requires volunteers to teach basic computer skills, so if you are a proficient computer user, it is more than enough.

I don’t have a technological background. Can I still volunteer?
We can definitely need some help around event management, communications, logistics and administration. Please contact Mireia if you want to find out more about it.
Our Women Program however, also requires volunteers to teach basic computer skills, so if you are a proficient computer user, it is more than enough.
Please contact Mireia if you want to find out more about it.

What time commitment does it mean for me?
Our regular courses are taught twice a week for about two hours in the evening (usually from 7 to 9 pm). The Women Program Courses run on weekends. Classes run usually on Saturdays from 10:00 - 14:00.
However, a team of teachers consists at least of three people so you don’t have to teach twice a week but only once. The key to a successful course is the efficient split of tasks and good communication between teachers and students. Preparation of each lesson can take up to 2h.
